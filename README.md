# squarescrape scrapes Squarespace to markdown

## How to

```
pip install requests bs4 html2text
python squarescrape.py
```

## Why

A few years ago, I was wanting to stop maintaining my own hand-rolled markdown blog setup. I found out that Squarespace had markdown support, so I was like oh ok cool I’ll be able to get it out in the future when I get around to moving to something else.

But then Squarespace basically locked in everyone who imported markdown blogs because there's no way to export the markdown, soooo I’ve been wanting to move all my shit out of their stupid product for years but it’s a giant pain. 

ChatGPT helped me build this little scraper in a few minutes, which was great because I had essentially zero interest in spending any time trying to export this stuff.
